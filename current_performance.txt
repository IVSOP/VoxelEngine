32x32 chunks (floor), each completely filled, 2.5 fps
same, but separated chunks quads according to normal, to only display what can be seen from players position, 5.5fps 
same, added culling for when there are voxels facing each other, but only inside the same chunk, max fps (165)
full 16x16x16 world: 59fps
full 16x16x16 world, with custom quad array: 68 fps
changed to 1B quads, 135fps
removed normal from vertices, 120fps, but allows other optimizations later
added greedy meshing. loading is painfully slow, but 800fps. Rendering is now the bottleneck, but not a priority. A simpler shader would get 10000+ fps
64x64x64 world (8,589,934,592 voxels): 90fps
